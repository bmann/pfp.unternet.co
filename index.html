      <strong>Protocols for Publishers</strong> is a virtual hackathon &amp; workshop series that brings together publishers, developers, and researchers to explore open protocols for a sustainable agentic web.</p>

    <h2>Why?</h2>

    <p>We're on the path to a new kind of web, with an uncertain future. AI-based user agents are now a core interface to the internet for over half-a-billion active users.</p>

    <p>This shift comes as platforms have increasingly seized control of the publisher-reader relationship: search engines broke their social contract with users by prioritizing ads over quality results, while social platforms have created walled gardens with algorithmic reach controlled by paid promotion. The rise of AI platforms could make these problems exponentially worse.</p>
      
      <p>For publishers, this raises critical questions: how can they engage as publishers, not a dataset to be scraped? How can they avoid being trapped by a new wave of mega-platforms? And how can they reach real users, build lasting relationships, and continue to have a equitable business model?</p>

      <p>
        <mark class="highlight">We believe the answer lies in technologists & publishers working together to explore & define the technology they want, instead of allowing others to dictate it for them.</mark>
      </p>

    <h2>What & when?</h2>

    <h3>Hackathon</h3>

    <p>We're running a virtual hackathon from <strong>July 14th â†’ August 8th</strong>, through a private Discord server where participants will have access to resources, peer check ins, and direct support for protocol questions and troubleshooting.</p>
    
    <p>Each week we'll start with a deep dive and example of the protocol, and live discussion. Each web publisher team will work on one or more self-guided learning exercises or experimental projects, with the goal of developing prototypes &amp; proofs-of-concepts.</p>

    <p>We'll focus on a different protocol per week, each led by builders &amp; experts in the field:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Week One:</strong> MCP</li>
      <li><strong>Week Two:</strong> Web Applets</li>
      <li><strong>Week Three:</strong> AT Protocol</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Summit @ Betaworks NYC</h3>

    <p>After the virtual hackathon, we'll plan to meet in New York for an in person summit, plus a few select guests. We'll recap what we learned, and share challenges and opportunities for the path ahead.</p>

    <p>An evening demo day will include a wider group of public demos and explorations of protocols, all hosted at Betaworks.</p>

    <h2>Who's behind this?</h2>

    <p>The Protocols for Publishers workshop is being organized by <a href="https://unternet.co">Unternet</a>, alongside some friends from the world of internet protocols. Unternet is developing <a href="https://unternet.co/docs/web-applets/introduction">Web Applets</a>, an open protocol for intelligent software on the web.</p>
